ZDevice is a Ruby DSL for assembling arbitrary ZeroMQ routing devices, with support for the ZDCF configuration syntax.

 * Blog post: [Routing with Ruby & ZeroMQ devices](http://www.igvita.com/2010/11/17/routing-with-ruby-zeromq-devices/)

## Example: PUB/SUB queue device

    b = ZMQ::Device::Builder.new(
      context: { iothreads: 5 },
      main: {
        type: :queue,
        frontend: { type: :SUB, option: { hwm: 1, swap: 25}, connect: ["tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"]},
        backend:  { type: :PUB, bind: ["tcp://127.0.0.1:5556"] }
      }
    )

    # relay all incoming messages to all subscribers
    b.main.start do
      loop do
        msg = ZMQ::Message.new
        frontend.recv msg
        backend.send msg
      end
    end
